# catprint
Bluetooth python cat printer

I ordered one of these: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0B391KN5S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 bluetooth thermal printers.

## Downsides
Sadly it didn't come with the 5 coloured pens which were promised in the product description. The app also wouldn't recognise the printer so it was pretty much useless out of the box.

## Upsides
It looks like someone has already experimented with a similar printer here: https://dev.to/mitchpommers/my-textable-cat-printer-18ge to make a cat printer that anyone can send a message to via text. I'm not going to do that. 

## Aim
I'd like a python library which allows you to connect to and control the bluetooth printer along with a simple web interface to print simple text messages
